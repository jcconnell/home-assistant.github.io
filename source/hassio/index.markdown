### {% linkable_title Upgrading %}

Hass.io users can update Home Assistant via the 'Hass.io' page in the UI. However, please note that a Home Assistant updates take time to roll into the Hass.io builds. Therefore there is often a slight delay between the availability of a Home Assistant update and the update being available in Hass.io, so be patient. When a Hass.io update is available, it will be shown as a notification in the â€˜Hass.io' page in the web interface.
